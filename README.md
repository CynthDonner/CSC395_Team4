## Project Overview
This application helps companies generate recipes based on their product ingredients. The app allows users to select a company, input ingredients, and receive an AI-generated recipe using the provided ingredients, with additional suggestions.
## Features
- **Company Selection**: Choose from a list of companies to generate a recipe.
- **Ingredient Input**: Provide a list of ingredients and let the AI generate a recipe.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Recipes are enhanced with extra ingredients that match the selected company.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and failed API calls.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests to ensure code robustness.

## Usage
    Select a company from the dropdown list.
    Enter the list of ingredients.
    Submit the form to generate a recipe.
    The AI will return a recipe name, tagline, and ingredients list based on your inputs.
## Unit Testing
We have set up unit tests to validate the functionality of the application. The tests cover:
- **Valid Input Handling**: Ensuring correct JSON input generates expected results.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring malformed or missing JSON, junk data, and failed API calls are handled gracefully.
- **API Connection**: Verifying behavior when the connection to the Ollama API fails.
## Running Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command:
bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
## Data Flow
![Data Flow Diagram](RecipeBrowser/docs/dataflowdiagram.png)
The applicationâ€™s data flow follows this process:
- **User Input**: The user selects a company and provides a list of ingredients.
- **Data Submission**: The form is submitted, sending a POST request to the /generate endpoint.
- **AI Interaction**: The Flask server forwards the user input to the Ollama API.
- **AI Response**: The Ollama API generates a recipe and returns it to the server.
- **Display**: The Flask app returns the AI-generated recipe to the user on the webpage.
