## Project Overview

This application helps companies generate recipes based on their product ingredients. The app allows users to select a company, input ingredients, and receive an AI-generated recipe using the provided ingredients, with additional suggestions.

## Features

- **Company Selection**: Choose from a list of companies to generate a recipe.
- **Ingredient Input**: Provide a list of ingredients and let the AI generate a recipe.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Recipes are enhanced with extra ingredients that match the selected company.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and failed API calls.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests to ensure code robustness.

## Usage

1. Select a company from the dropdown list.
2. Enter the list of ingredients.
3. Submit the form to generate a recipe.
4. The AI will return a recipe name, tagline, and ingredients list based on your inputs.

## Unit Testing

We have set up unit tests to validate the functionality of the application. The tests cover:

- **Valid Input Handling**: Ensuring correct JSON input generates expected results.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring malformed or missing JSON, junk data, and failed API calls are handled gracefully.
- **API Connection**: Verifying behavior when the connection to the Ollama API fails.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:


python -m unittest discover -s tests


## Data Flow

The applicationâ€™s data flow follows this process:

    User Input: The user selects a company and provides a list of ingredients.
    Data Submission: The form is submitted, sending a POST request to the /generate endpoint.
    AI Interaction: The Flask server forwards the user input to the Ollama API.
    AI Response: The Ollama API generates a recipe and returns it to the server.
    Display: The Flask app returns the AI-generated recipe to the user on the webpage.
